The team is currently coached by Brian Kelly and play home games at the campus' Notre Dame Stadium, with a capacity of 80,795. Notre Dame competes as an Independent at the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision level and is a founding member of the Bowl Championship Series coalition (BCS). The Fighting Irish hold the highest winning percentage among college football programs and have 13 national championships recognized by the NCAA, tied for first out of all FBS schools in the post-1900 era. A record seven Notre Dame players have won the Heisman trophy and the program has produced an NCAA record 97 consensus All-Americans and 33 unanimous All-Americans, more than any other university. As of the 2014 NFL Draft, Notre Dame has produced and have had drafted the most NFL players of all-time.</p>

<p>All Notre Dame home games are televised on Notre Dame Football on NBC. Notre Dame is the only individual school to have its own national television contract, declined a subsequent invitation by the Big Ten to join the conference, and is the only independent program to be part of the BCS coalition and its guaranteed payout. These factors help make Notre Dame one of the most financially valuable football programs in the country.

<p> American football did not have an auspicious beginning at the University of Notre Dame. In their inaugural game on November 23, 1887 the Irish lost to Michigan by a score of 8–0. Their first win came in the final game of the 1888 season when the Irish defeated Harvard Prep by a score of 20–0. At the end of the 1888 season they had a record of 1–3 with all three losses being at the hands of Michigan by a combined score of 43–9. Between 1887 and 1899 Notre Dame compiled a record of 31 wins, 15 losses, and four ties against a diverse variety of opponents ranging from local high school teams to other universities.</p>

<p>Notre Dame continued its success near the turn of the century and achieved their first victory over Michigan in 1909 by the score of 11 to 3 after which Michigan refused to play Notre Dame again for 33 years. By the end of the 1912 season they had amassed a record of 108 wins, 31 losses, and 13 ties.
